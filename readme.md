![Screenshot](https://de.object-storage.net/apps/sharingpath/Static/Files/SDRPlusPlus.png)
SDR++ is a cross-platform and open source SDR software with the aim of being bloat free and simple to use.

## Features

* Multi VFO
* Wide hardware support (both through SoapySDR and dedicated modules)
* SIMD accelerated DSP
* Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS and BSD)
* Full waterfall update when possible. Makes browsing signals easier and more pleasant
* Modular design (easily write your own plugins)

# Installing

## MacOS (Apple Silicon M1, M2)

Download the app bundle from the latest [nightly build](https://github.com/KentuckyFriedData/SDRPlusPlus-Mac-ARM64/releases/tag/nightly)
then install the `SDR++.app` bundle by dragging it into Applications.

# Module List

Not all modules are built by default. I decided to disable the build of those with large libraries, libraries that can't be installed through the package manager (or pothos) and those that are still in beta.
Modules in beta are still included in releases for the most part but not enabled in SDR++ (need to be instantiated).

# Troubleshooting

First, please make sure you're running the latest automated build. If your issue is linked to a bug it is likely that is has already been fixed in later releases

## SDR++ crashes then it won't start again no matter what

This is a bug in 1.0.0 that was fixed in 1.0.1

In some cases, if a crash happened while the config was being saved, the config file would be corrupted and SDR++ would refuse to start because of it.

This has now been fixed. If a config file is corrupted it'll just reset it to its default state.

## "hash collision" error when starting

You likely installed the `soapysdr-module-all` package on Ubuntu/Debian. If not it's still a SoapySDR bug caused by multiple soapy modules coming in conflict. Uninstall anything related to SoapySDR then install soapysdr itself and only the soapy modules you actually need.

## "I don't see -insert module name here-, what's going on?"

If the module was included in a later update, it's not enabled in the config. The easiest way to fix this is just to delete the `config.json` file and let SDR++ recreate it (you will lose your setting relating to the main UI like VFO colors, zoom level and theme).
The best option however is to edit the config file to add an instance of the module you wish to have enabled (see the Module List).

## SDR++ crashes when stopping a RTL-SDR

This is a bug recently introduced by libusb1.4
To solve, this, simply downgrade to libusb1.3

## SDR++ crashes when starting a HackRF

If you also have the SoapySDR module enabled, this is a bug in libhackrf. It's caused by libhackrf not checking if it's already initialized.
The solution until a fixed libhackrf version is released is to disable the soapy_source module from SDR++. For this, go into the "Module Manager" menu and click the `-` button next to the row with "soapy_source". After that, restart SDR++.

## Issue not listed here?

If you still have an issue, please open an issue about it or ask on the discord. I'll try to respond as quickly as I can. Please avoid trying to contact me on every platform imaginable thinking I'll respond faster though...
